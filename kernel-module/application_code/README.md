# Application Program to Read from a Device File

This code is a simple C program that reads data from a device file in Linux. It opens the specified device file (`/dev/mychardev` by default), reads data from it, and then displays the data to the console.

## Header Files

The program includes the following standard C header files:

- `stdio.h`: Standard input/output functions.
- `stdlib.h`: Standard library functions.
- `fcntl.h`: File control functions.
- `unistd.h`: POSIX operating system API functions.

## Definitions

- `DEVICE_FILE`: Defines the path to the device file (`/dev/mychardev`). You can change this to the actual path of your device file if it's different.

## Main Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

- `int main()`: Declares the main function.

## Variables

- `fd`: File descriptor for the device file.
- `buffer`: Buffer to store the data read from the device file.
- `bytes_read`: Number of bytes read from the device file.

## File Operations

- Opens the device file for reading (`O_RDONLY` flag).
- Reads data from the device file into the buffer.
- Checks for errors during file operations.

## Error Handling

- If opening or reading from the device file fails, an error message is printed using `perror`.
- The program exits with a failure status (`EXIT_FAILURE`).

## Displaying Data

- Displays the data read from the device file to the console using `printf`.

## Closing the Device File

- Closes the device file using the `close` function.

## Return Value

- Returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.
